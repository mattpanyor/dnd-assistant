Sacrificed to the God of Fear, she was resurrected as a cursed creature of Fear. Bound to respawn at her death-altar, she wields fear and siphons life, a transformed survivor weaponizing the nightmares of others.

## To simple life to horrific return

She was born the daughter of a peasant family in a secluded village. When she was fourteen, cultists devoted to the God of Fear descended upon the settlement in a brutal raid. She was taken captive, dragged into the Shadow Fey realm, and sacrificed upon an altar of dread, where she died.

Death did not claim her completely. Her soul endured, lingering long enough to find its way back to her body. Several hours later, she awakened in a ditch near the temple where the sacrifice had taken place. Disoriented and terrified, she fled back to her village, only to discover it burned to ash by the kingdom’s Inquisition, eradicated after signs of cultist corruption were uncovered.

## From death to life

With her family dead and her former life erased, she withdrew into a remote cave. There she discovered that, through some inexplicable accident, she had torn a fragment of power from the God of Fear himself. The change was immediate and unmistakable. Her once-blonde hair turned jet black, her irises shimmered with a faint violet glow, and black veins traced across her skin. Dark, fey-like wings emerged from her back. She was no longer human.

While learning to control her newfound power, she fell from the sky and died again—only to awaken once more at the same altar where she had first been sacrificed. It was then she understood that death could not hold her. No matter how she perished, she would always return to the beginning of her path, as though her existence were bound to that moment.

# Gift of Fear

Years passed as she honed her abilities. She did not age, whether due to true immortality or the extended lifespan of the fey she could not say, nor did she care to find out. She learned to siphon life, to inspire dread in the hearts of others, and to wield fey arcane power alongside the fear she carried within her.

She gained the ability to sense fear in living beings, allowing her to locate them within a short distance. She could also perceive the nature of their nightmares and waking terrors. She learned to infuse her power into small trinkets or flowers, corrupting them in the process. These objects could protect or harm those who carried them by manifesting their own fears, often with unpredictable consequences.
