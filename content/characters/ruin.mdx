A being torn between two worlds, Ruin embodies the eternal conflict between divine and demonic forces. Cast out by both heaven and hell for her mixed heritage, she walks the mortal realm as a harbinger of change and destruction, wielding powers that mortals were never meant to witness.

#

## The Forbidden Union

Born from the impossible union of an archangel and a demon lord, Ruin should never have existed. Heaven declared her an abomination, while Hell viewed her as a threat. Neither realm wanted a being that could command both divine light and infernal darkness. Her very existence challenged the cosmic order.

## The Great Rejection

When Ruin came of age, both her celestial and infernal parents were forced to choose—their realms or their daughter. They chose their own dimensions. Cast down from the heavens and banished from the hells, Ruin fell to the mortal realm, where she crashed to earth like a falling star, leaving a crater that still smolders with divine and demonic energy.

## Embracing the Name

Stripped of her birthright and rejected by both halves of her heritage, she took the name "Ruin" as a promise—if the cosmos rejected her, she would become the end of it. She would reshape the multiple realms to her image and rule eternally as an overgod of everything.

# Powers & Abilities

## Dual Nature

Ruin can channel both holy and unholy energies, often simultaneously. Her right hand can heal with divine light while her left burns with hellfire. This duality makes her unpredictable in combat—she can bless and curse in the same breath, create and destroy with equal ease.

## Powers of Contradiction

Her wings grant her flight and serve as conduits for her powers. She can summon barriers of pure light and unleash beams of radiant energy on the other hand she can engulf enemies in shadowflame and summon chains of burning darkness. When she works in concert, she can create devastating vortexes of twilight energy.

## Forbidden Magic

As a demigod of both worlds, Ruin has access to magic that exists in the spaces between divine and demonic—twilight magic that manipulates the very fabric of reality. She can blur the lines between life and death, order and chaos, creation and annihilation.

# Personality & Traits

## Character Traits

- Speaks with bitter eloquence, often quoting scripture and infernal texts ironically
- Distrusts authority figures from any alignment
- Shows unexpected kindness to children
- Struggles with identity—caught between two natures, belonging to neither
- Views rules and traditions as chains to be broken

## Strengths

Her dual nature makes her resistant to both holy and unholy attacks. She can adapt to almost any magical threat by shifting her balance between light and dark. Her raw power exceeds most mortal spellcasters, and her demigod heritage grants her near-immortality.

## Weaknesses

Ruin's internal conflict causes her physical pain when she heavily favors one nature over the other. Prolonged use of purely divine or purely demonic power tears at her essence. She also carries deep emotional wounds from her rejection, making her vulnerable to manipulation through loneliness and the desire for acceptance.

# Quest for Balance

## Current Mission

Ruin seeks the Nexus of Twilight, a legendary place where the boundaries between all realms blur. There, she believes, she can find a place of power enought to topple realms. [to be developled further]

# Relationships & Conflicts

## Hunted by Both Sides

Heaven sends its holy knights to destroy her as an abomination. Hell dispatches its assassins to eliminate a potential threat. Ruin has learned to fight both with equal ferocity, taking grim satisfaction in turning their servants against each other.
