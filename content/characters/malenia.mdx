A legendary warrior of unparalleled skill, Malenia wields her prosthetic blade with deadly grace. Cursed with the Scarlet Rot from birth, she has turned her affliction into a weapon, becoming one of the most feared combatants in all the realms. Her crimson hair flows like a banner of war, and her golden prosthetic arm gleams with lethal beauty.

## The Cursed Demigod

Born a demigod but afflicted with the Scarlet Rot—a divine plague that slowly consumes her body—Malenia refused to let her curse define her. Instead, she trained relentlessly, mastering the blade until she could fight without sight, relying purely on instinct and years of discipline. Her brother Miquella became her anchor, her reason to keep fighting against the inevitable decay.

## The Undefeated

Through countless battles, Malenia has never tasted defeat. Warriors from across the land have challenged her, drawn by tales of her legendary skill. None have succeeded. Her signature technique, the Waterfowl Dance, is a whirlwind of steel that few survive witnessing, let alone defending against.

## The Prosthetic Warrior

When the Scarlet Rot claimed her arm and leg, Malenia replaced them with golden prosthetics of masterful craftsmanship. Rather than handicaps, these have become extensions of her deadly art. The weight and balance of her prosthetic blade arm allows for strikes impossible for ordinary warriors.

# Combat Style & Abilities

## Waterfowl Dance

Malenia's signature technique is a devastating aerial assault. She launches herself into the air, spinning and slashing in a hurricane of blades that strikes multiple times in rapid succession. Those caught in this dance rarely survive to speak of it.

## Scarlet Aeonia

When pressed, Malenia can unleash the Scarlet Rot within her, manifesting as a massive bloom of decay. This technique devastates everything in its radius, though using it accelerates her own corruption. It is both her ultimate weapon and greatest sacrifice.

## Masterful Swordsmanship

Even without her divine techniques, Malenia's pure bladework is unmatched. Her movements are fluid and precise, each strike calculated with mathematical perfection. She fights as if the sword is an extension of her very soul.

# Personality & Traits

## Character Traits

- Speaks with calm confidence born from countless victories
- Fiercely protective of her brother Miquella
- Shows respect to worthy opponents, though few earn it
- Carries herself with quiet dignity despite her affliction
- Refuses pity or sympathy regarding her condition

## Strengths

Her technical skill with a blade surpasses all known warriors. Combined with her demigod constitution and supernatural techniques, she represents the pinnacle of martial prowess. Her inability to feel pain from her rotted limbs has become a tactical advantage—wounds that would cripple others merely inconvenience her.

## Weaknesses

The Scarlet Rot continually spreads through her body. Each use of her divine power accelerates the corruption. Her devotion to Miquella can cloud her judgment, making her vulnerable to manipulation through threats to her brother. Her pride as an undefeated warrior makes retreat or surrender unthinkable, even when tactically sound.

# Quest & Purpose

## Current Mission

Malenia seeks a cure for the Scarlet Rot, not for herself, but to save her brother Miquella from a similar fate. Ancient texts speak of a divine remedy hidden in the depths of the Haligtree, but the path is fraught with dangers even she finds challenging.

## The Undefeated Legacy

Every battle adds to her legend. Malenia fights not for glory or conquest, but to prove that even those cursed and broken can achieve perfection. She is a testament to the triumph of will over fate, skill over handicap, and determination over destiny.

## Awaiting the Next Challenger

Though undefeated, Malenia continues to test herself against worthy opponents. She seeks not merely victory, but the perfect duel—a battle that will push her to her absolute limits and beyond. Until then, she remains vigilant, ever ready to draw her blade in her brother's name.
