A fairy warlock with iridescent wings that shimmer in shades of purple and blue, Della is the exiled first princess of the Gold-Sun dynasty who rules the Summer Court. Her pact with an archfey from another dimension grants her terrifying powers over age and time, which she wields in pursuit of true immortality.

## Origins in the Feywild

Born as the first princess of the Gold-Sun dynasty, Della grew up in the eternal summer of the Feywild's Summer Court. Restless with the endless revelry and predictable enchantments of her gilded cage, she turned to forbidden knowledge and darker magics.

## The Pact

When Della's desperate plea for greater power was answered, it came from an unexpected source: Dorian Grey, a powerful archfey from the future of another dimension. This otherworldly patron taught her the art of turning life into stillness—stealing vitality from others and freezing time itself. This pact set her on an obsessive path toward achieving true immortality.

## Life as a Wanderer

Now exiled from the Summer Court, Della wanders the mortal realm as a pretend adventurer, pursuing dark knowledge and arcane secrets to perfect her immortality. Her eyes sparkle with eternal curiosity, though her shy nature and simple, childlike speech prevent her from forming deep connections with others.

# Powers & Abilities

## Temporal Painting

Della's pact grants her a unique and sinister ability: she can paint anything on canvas, and through sacrifice—either life force or precious alloys—she can manipulate time itself. She can freeze time for objects or small animals entirely, or visually age medium creatures. These curses remain active until the painting is destroyed, and she maintains a supernatural connection to anything she has cursed through her art.

## The Price of Immortality

Della's body is her own experiment. In her first attempt at self-immortality, she painted herself as eternally young and successfully halted her aging—but only partially. While her body no longer ages, she is not truly immortal yet. The ritual stripped all color from her skin, leaving her pale as the canvas itself, an unnatural appearance that marks her even among the fey.

# Appearance & Personality

## The Pale Princess

Della's appearance tells the story of her obsession. Her iridescent wings shimmer with purple and blue hues, but her skin is unnaturally pale—bleached white like canvas from her failed immortality experiment.

## The Warding Mask

Della crafted her signature mask herself—a masterwork of both artifice and arcane protection. The silver surface is etched with intricate warding glyphs that shield her from divination magic, making her presence difficult to scry or track through magical means. More importantly, the mask serves as a barrier against the corrupting influences of the dark magics she experiments with, as well as protection from malevolent energies wielded by other dark practitioners. Though it appears to be solid silver, the mask can move and shift at will—the metallic surface rippling to display facial expressions and emotional mimicry. This animated quality, while useful for blending in, carries a slightly creepy vibe, as the movements are too smooth, too perfect, never quite matching the warmth of genuine emotion. The mask has become an essential part of her identity—both a shield and a disguise, concealing not just her pale features but also her true nature from those who might seek to divine her secrets or turn her own dark arts against her.
