quote: "The mortal realm holds such delicious mysteries..."
---

A mischievous fairy warlock with iridescent wings that shimmer in shades of purple and blue. Her pact with an ancient archfey grants her mysterious powers, and her eyes sparkle with eternal curiosity about the mortal realm.

# Background

## Origins in the Feywild

Born in the eternal twilight of the Feywild, Della grew restless with the endless revelry and predictable enchantments of her homeland. The Twilight Court's eternal dance and sparkling glamours that once delighted her eventually became as predictable as the mortal sunrise.

## The Pact

When the Archfey of the Twilight Court offered her a pact—power in exchange for stories from the mortal realm—she leaped at the chance. This bargain granted her warlock abilities far beyond typical fey magic, but bound her to collect and deliver tales of mortal adventures.

## Current Life

Now she flits between worlds, seeking adventure, collecting tales, and occasionally causing delightful chaos wherever her curiosity leads her. Each story she gathers strengthens her connection to both realms.
