A shy fairy warlock with iridescent wings that shimmer in shades of purple and blue. Her pact with an archfey called Dorian Grey grants her powers over age and time, and her eyes sparkle with eternal curiosity about the mortal realm, but her shy personality prevents her from interacting too much.

## Origins in the Feywild

Born in the eternal summer of the Feywild, Della grew up as the first princess of the Gold-Sun dynasty who rules the Summer Court, restless with the endless revelry and predictable enchantments of her homeland. She became bored of her gilded cage and started pursuing darker magics.

## The Pact

A rare event, when her plea was answered by a powerful archfey from the future of another dimension, Dorian Grey taught her how to turn life into stillness and suck it out from others. Her life goal is to discover the fine art of this ability and make herself truly immortal.

## Current Life

She now wanders the mortal realm to discover how she can keep time at bay and her own end forcibly stopped. She is a pretend adventurer pursuing dark knowledge in hopes of leveling up her skills to reach her own immortality.

# Personality & Traits

## Character Quirks

- Speaks rarely and when she does, mostly uses simple words like a kid
- Cannot resist exploring dark magic and has no moral compass when it comes to practicing it
- Collects pictures which will make things never fade
- Easily distracted by things

## Abilities

Her innate ability as a magic user and her unusually dark side make her a formidable opponent. Her pact skill allows her to paint anything on a canvas, then after a sacrifice of either life or precious alloys, she can stop time for an object or even a small animal entirely, or visually age up to a medium creature. This curse is active until the painting is destroyed. She also feels a connection to the cursed through her paintings.

## Drawbacks

Her body is her own experiment. Although she managed to stop her bodily functions from aging, she isn't immortal yet. Additionally, the procedure made her skin turn pale like the canvas she drew on. She doesn't show her skin in social circumstances and wears an enchanted mask made by her under the instructions of her patron.

# Appearance

## Eternal beauty

Her long-term goal is immortality and beauty. She drew herself as if she were very young on the first attempt to make herself immortal. The procedure was only a half successâ€”her bodily age stopped and indeed her beauty was captured, but her skin lost the colors it once had. She is now a pale, eternally young fey. At least until she finds a proper method to repaint herself and gain her color back.

## Enchanted mask

As Della felt she would stand out (especially among fey) with her unnatural skin color, she decided to wear elaborate clothing wrapped in arcane runes to protect her from any dark magic during experimentation. Her patron also gave her the knowledge to create an enchanted silver mask that mimics mortal emotions to be able to conceal her identity yet function in society.
