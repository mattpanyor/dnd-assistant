## Celestial Origins

Born in the high peaks where the mountains touch the clouds, Dante was chosen by the celestial powers to become a Seraphâ€”a divine warrior tasked with vanquishing the enemies of Heaven. His giant heritage gives him unmatched strength, while his angelic calling grants him divine magic and wisdom beyond mortal comprehension.

## The Divine Calling

When darkness threatened to consume the lowlands, the heavens called upon Dante. Clad in armor forged from blessed gold and starlight, he descended from his mountain sanctuary to walk among mortals. Each piece of his armor bears holy inscriptions that glow with radiant energy when evil draws near.

## Road of a Mercenary

Now Dante travels the realm, seeking out those who need a soldier of divine origin to execute evil. His golden armor gleams like a second sun, a symbol of hope to the righteous or at least who have the coin.
